Rails3-amf is a Rails 3 plugin that aims to do what RubyAMF did for Rails 2. It
provides extensively customizable ActiveRecord serialization support, simple
configuration, and allows AMF calls to any controller you choose. It uses
RocketAMF for serialization, providing users with a proven AMF0/3 serializer and
deserializer.


== GETTING STARTED:

To get started with rails3-amf, all you need to do is add the following two
lines to your gemfile. RocketAMF will need to be pulled from git for now, as
there are several necessary updates that have been made to it to allow
rails3-amf to work properly.

  gem 'RocketAMF', :git => 'git://github.com/warhammerkid/rocket-amf.git'
  gem 'rails3-amf', :git => 'git://github.com/warhammerkid/rails3-amf.git'

Then, make sure that your controller will respond to amf by adding <tt>:amf</tt>
to your respond_to, and you should be all ready to go. ActiveRecord objects will automatically be serialized with all attributes and no relations, but that can be easilly adjusted through the standard serialization options for ActiveRecord and ActiveModel serialization.

  class UserController < ApplicationController
    respond_to :html, :amf
  
    def getUser
      @user = User.first
      respond_with(@user) do |format|
        format.amf { render :amf => @user.to_amf(:except => [:updated_at, :created_at], :include => [:courses]) }
      end
    end
  end
